## About Me:

	- I try to contribute about 10-15 hours a month to web application training. Webapp development has been a hobby for about 2 years. Ive skipped about 2 or 3 months at a time because of work and school.

## About the Project:
This is my first project, "contest" type of project. I need to start pushing myself to do something. Developing any webpage is better than developing nothing. I really enjoy this hobby but because of my time constraints its really difficult. Time passes by and i have to refer to my notes when Im trying to do a webpage.

Since it was a simple project I just worked it on the fly by sections. I first thought about the layout, well a layout I was capable of programming. I browsed a couple of restaurant website but alot of them were pretty complicated and javascript heavy, those looked pretty awesome but wouldve been time consuming for this project. After deciding on a simple layout I did the coding by sections, starting with the navbar. For each section, I started with html code then did the css styling. Being that im stronger at designing for desktop, I did the desktop layout first. Once I was done, I did the responsive layout for tablet viewport size  followed by the phone viewport size.
